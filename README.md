# Vacator
Dashboard to show the place on where we can go for vacation


### What I used ?
 - [x] Python3.6
 - [x] Qt framework for cross platform: Windows / Mac / Linux (under development on Linux).
 - [x] Javascript language for logic on UI, like manage data on the Items(QML).
 - [X] QML language for designing the UI provided by Qt Company.
 - [x] Brain :)

### Usage
How to install requirements so that you can launch the UI. It is just the requests library for Pythonto enable request to dClimate API.
these requirements is under requirements.txt.

#### 1. using final pip package (you can run it anytime), you can see what I'm developing.
You can clone and try it using simple command :)
```
git clone https://github.com/bm777/vacator.git
cd vacator
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

#### 2. using final pip package (you could do until I finish the development)
You have only have the possibility to launch as a pip3 software.
I'm preparing the pip file so that you can do easily
```
pip3 install vacator
```
